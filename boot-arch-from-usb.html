Modify the cmdline.txt root entry to

```bash
root=PARTUUID=24da48ba-02
```

Change the 2 lines in /etc/fstab to

```bash
PARTUUID=24da48ba-01  /boot           vfat    defaults          0       2
PARTUUID=24da48ba-02  /               ext4    defaults,noatime  0       1
```

NOTE the console=ttyAMA0,115200 is NOT NEEDED if you are not using a serial console. The kernel debugger is also connected to this port kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 and is definitely NOT needed!

For reference, the following is my cmdline.txt:

```bash
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=c49c1da4-02 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait
```
